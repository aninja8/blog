Fascinated by technology from a very young age, I am currently a full stack developer. From my first program to draw a smiley in BASIC to the latest one that can classify objects in images, I have been enthralled by this journey. 

I have a professional experience of 2+ years during which I wore the hat of an E-Commerce Developer. I can safely say that now I know how E-Commerce works and I can handle any amount of challenges in that.

I have also contributed to the development of various innovative projects related to eCommerce in these 2 years such as E-Commerce store in TV, augmented reality shopping experience in E-Commerce, Visual search and so on.

Apart from my professional experience, I have been actively involved in building a lot of web and mobile apps right from college.

I have worn the hat of a front end and back end developer from time to time.

I have been fascinated by image processing and natural language processing from the time I worked on my final project. I devote some of my free time trying to learn them. 

I am also interested in Open Source projects. I am messing around with WordPress and I hope to contribute soon!

To this day, I am happy I embarked on the journey to become a developer. It has been so exciting so far. 

I look forward to reach different levels and all the while enjoy this journey.

Apart from writing code, I also enjoy writing, travelling and reading! I can speak three languages fluently. I am learning the fourth one(French! Je parle un peu fran√ßais!). I can read and understand Sanskrit too. I am on my way of becoming a polyglot.

Reach out if you would like to talk about the technology!
